# Algorithm Project
# Goal

**This is a algorithm project.  In order to teach  common algorithms.**



Codes of this project mostly from LeetCode. You can search any case which has been added by LeetCode number or function name.



This project not only include LeetCode case, but also include other resources.





# Do you need it? Yes, if you want some good ideas.

In a case, at least include one solution.  If it have any good way to solve it, it will be added into this project. Such as brute force, binary search, dynamic programming.



# How to use this project?

I suggest you should begin with easy case on LeetCode. If you want some good ideas or thoughts, you could search from this project.



# Help?

If you have any suggestions or advises, Please let me know.

 

All cases classification by array , linkedlist, queue etc.
